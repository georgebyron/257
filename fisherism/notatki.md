1. From Mark's memorial in Goldsmith, the moment, when Kodwo Eshun cites all branches that emerges from Mark's writing. As the way how he broke the capitalist realism. After Brassier/Hegel/?: you need to be outside to describe the opposition. This is the way in which, in my opinion, Mark developed possible futures. And they have emerged into new combinations \(such as the solarpunk\). Now, this is an another brick in this emergence, point where we can meet again and talk with each other.
2. Because the question about the future is the question about the now - how should it be, we see only what doesn't work right now and and should work in the future.
