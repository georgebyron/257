# Pandemic

## Introduction _Noli me tangere_

"Touch me not" J20:17

  
Christ says he will be there whenever there is love between his believers. He will be there not as a person to touch, but as the bond of love and solidarity between people—so, “do not touch me, touch and deal with other people in the spirit of love.”

Young Hegel:  
The human being is this night, this empty noth-ing, that contains everything in its simplicity— an unending wealth of many representations, images, of which none belongs to him—or which are not present. One catches sight of this night when one looks human beings in the eye.

There is no return to normal, the new “normal” will have to be constructed on the ruins of our old lives, or we will find ourselves in a new barbarism whose signs are already clearly discernible. \(p.3\)

What is wrong with our system that we were caught unprepared by the catastrophe despite scientists warning us about it for years?

## We're all in the same boat now

It's about China, and how significant it was when the Marxist student has disappeared.

The most dangerous thing to do today in China is to believe seriously in the state’s own official ideology. China is now paying the price for such a stance:

The coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled,” according to Hong Kong’s lead- ing public health epidemiologist Gabriel Leung. “People needed to have faith and trust in their government while the uncertainties of the new outbreak were worked out by the scientific com- munity,” he said, “and of course when you have social media and fake news and real news all mixed in there and then zero trust, how do you fight that epidemic? You need extra trust, an extra sense of solidarity, an extra sense of goodwill, all of which have been completely used up. \(p.10\)

The chief argument against the idea that the state has to control rumors to prevent panic is that this control itself spreads distrust and thus creates even more conspiracy theories.

As the world-wide epidemic develops, we need to be aware that market mechanisms will not be enough to pre- vent chaos and hunger. Measures that appear to most of us today as “Communist” will have to be considered on a global level: coordination of production and distribution will have to take place outside the coordinates of the mar- ket. One should recall here the Irish potato famine in the 1840s that devastated Ireland, with millions dead or com- pelled to emigrate. The British state retained their trust in market mechanisms, exporting food from Ireland even when vast numbers were suffering. We must hope that a similar brutal solution is no longer acceptable today.\(p.12\)

The usual suspects are waiting in line to be questioned: globalization, the capitalist market, the tran- sience of the rich. However, we should resist the temp- tation to treat the ongoing epidemic as something that has a deeper meaning: the cruel but just punishment of humanity for the ruthless exploitation of other forms of life on earth. If we search for such a hidden message, we remain premodern: we treat our universe as a partner in communication. Even if our very survival is threatened, there is something reassuring in the fact that we are punished, the universe \(or even Somebody-out-there\) is engaging with us. We matter in some profound way. The really difficult thing to accept is the fact that the ongoing epidemic is a result of natural contingency at its purest, that it just happened and hides no deeper meaning. In the larger order of things, we are just a species with no special importance. \(p.14\)

## Why are we tired all the time?

Here is a short resume of Byung-Chul Han’s masterpiece of the same name, \(_the Burnout Society_\) shamelessly but gratefully lifted from Wikipedia:

Driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as well as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the same time and enter a swirl of demarcation, self-exploitation and collapse. When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of produc- tion him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antago- nism. This is what accounts for the system’s sta- bility.” Han argues that subjects become self-ex- ploiters: “Today, everyone is an auto-exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise. People are now master and slave in one. Even class strug- gle has transformed into an inner struggle against oneself.” The individual has become what Han calls “the achievement-subject”; the individual does not believe they are subjugated “subjects” but rather “projects: Always refashioning and reinventing ourselves” which “amounts to a form of compulsion and constraint—indeed, to a more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation. As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the I is now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization.

Zizek shows in following paragraphs, how the constrains, described by the Han, are not only internal. They can be external, what can be perceived as strange in the liberal world. Examples are mostly about people who were, in different cases, against Israel policy.

A gap separates the top manager who owns or runs a company from a precarious worker spending days at home alone with his/her personal computer—they are definitely not both a master and a slave in the same sense.

A lot is being written about how the old Fordist assembly line way of working is replaced by a new mode of cooperative work that leaves much more space for indi- vidual creativity. However, what is effectively going on is not so much a replacement, but an outsourcing: work for Microsoft and Apple may be organized in a more coopera- tive fashion, but their final products are then put together in China or Indonesia in a very Fordist way—assembly line work is simply outsourced. So we get a new divi- sion of work: self-employed and self-exploited workers \(described by Han\) in the developed West, debilitating assembly line work in the Third World, plus the growing domain of human care workers in all its forms \(caretak- ers, waiters . . .\) where exploitation also abounds. Only the first group \(self-employed, often precarious workers\) fits Han’s description.

Each of the three groups implies a specific mode of being tired and overworked. The assembly line work is simply debilitating in its repetitiveness—workers get des- perately tired of assembling again and again the same iPhone behind a table in a Foxconn factory in a suburb of Shanghai. In contrast to this tiredness, what makes the human-care work so weary is the very fact that they are expected to labor with empathy, to seem to care about the “objects” of their work: a kindergarten worker is paid not just to look after children but to show affection for them, the same goes for those who take care of the old or the sick. One can imagine the strain of constantly “being nice.” In contrast to the first two spheres where we can at least maintain some kind of inner distance towards what we are doing \(even when we are expected to treat a child nicely, we can just pretend to do so\), the third sphere demands of us something which is much more tiresome. Imagine being hired to publicize or package a product in order to seduce people into buying it—even if personally one doesn’t care about the product or even hates the very idea of it. One has to engage creativity quite intensely, trying to figure out original solutions, and such an effort can be much more exhausting than repetitive assembly line work. This is the specific tiredness Han is talking about.

But it is not only precarious workers laboring behind their PC screen at home who exhaust themselves through self-exploitation. Another group should be mentioned here, usually referred to by the deceptive term “creative team work.”4 These are workers who are expected to undertake entrepreneurial functions on behalf of higher management or owners. They deal “creatively” with social organization of production and with its distribution. The role of such groups is ambiguous: on the one hand, “by appropriating the entrepreneurial functions, work- ers deal with the social character and meaning of their work in the confined form of profitability”: “The ability to organize labor and combined cooperation efficiently and economically, and to think about the socially use- ful character of labour, is useful for mankind and always will be.”5 However, they are doing this under the contin- uous subordination of capital, i.e., with the aim of mak- ing the company more efficient and profitable, and it is this tension which makes such “creative team work” so exhausting. They are held responsible for the success of the company, while their team work also involves com- petition among themselves and with other groups. As organizers of the work process, they are paid to perform arole that traditionally belonged to capitalists. And so, with all the worries and  responsibilities of management while remaining paid workers insecure of their future, they get the worst of both worlds.

## Towards a perfect storm in Europe

Three storms are gathering and combining their force above Europe. The first two are not specific to Europe: the coronavirus epidemic in its direct physical impact \(quarantines, suffering and death\) and its economic effects which will be worse in Europe than elsewhere since the continent is already stagnating, and is also more dependent than other regions of the world on imports and exports \(for instance, the car industry is the backbone of the German economy, and the export of luxury cars to China is already at a standstill.\) To these two storms, we have to add now a third one which we can call the Putogan virus: the new explosion of violence in Syria between Turkey and the Assad regime \(directly supported by Russia\). Both sides are coldly exploiting the suffering of millions of displaced people for their own political gains.

One should avoid the game of asking who is more responsible, Erdogan or Putin, for the crisis. They are both worse and should be treated as what they are: war criminals using the suffering of millions and destroying a country to ruthlessly pursue their goals, among which is the destruction of a united Europe. Furthermore, they are now doing this in the context of a global epidemic, a time when global cooperation is more urgent than ever, using the fear this induces as a means of pursuing their military goals. In a world with a minimal sense of justice, their place should be not in presidential palaces but the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

Now we can see how the combination of three storms makes a perfect storm: a new wave of refugees organized by Turkey can have catastrophic consequences in this time of the coronavirus epidemic. Up until now, one of the few good things about the epidemic, alongside the basic fact that it has made us sharply aware of the need for global cooperation, has been that is has not been attributed to immigrants and refugees—racism was at work mostly in perceiving the threat as originating from the Oriental Other. But if the two issues get mixed together, if refu- gees are perceived as linked to the spread of the epidemic \(and of course there are likely to be widespread infection of coronavirus among refugees given the conditions in the crowded camps they occupy\), then populist racists will have their heyday: they will be able to justify their exclusion of foreigners with “scientific” medical reasons. Sympathetic policies allowing the influx of refugees could easily trigger a reaction of panic and fear. As prime min- ister Viktor Orban claimed in a recent speech, Hungary could effectively become the model for all Europe to follow.

## Welcome to the viral desert

But maybe another and much more beneficent ide- ological virus will spread and hopefully infect us: the virus of thinking of an alternate society, a society beyond nation-state, a society that actualizes itself in the forms of global solidarity and cooperation.

Years ago, Fredric Jameson drew attention to the uto- pian potential in movies about a cosmic catastrophe such as an asteroid threatening life on earth, or a virus wiping out humanity. Such a universal threat gives birth to global solidarity, our petty differences become insignificant, we all work together to find a solution—and here we are today, in real life. This is not a call to sadistically enjoy widespread suffering insofar as it helps our Cause—on the contrary, the point is to reflect upon the sad fact that we need a catastrophe to be able to rethink the very basic fea- tures of the society in which we live.

And we are not dealing only with viral threats—other catastrophes are looming on the horizon or already tak- ing place: droughts, heatwaves, killer storms, the list is long. In all these cases, the answer is not panic but the hard and urgent work to establish some kind of efficient global coordination.

We should not be afraid to note some potentially beneficial side effect of the epidemic. One of the lasting symbols of the epidemic is passengers trapped in quaran- tine on large cruise ships. Good riddance to the obscen- ity of such ships say I, though we have to be careful that travel to lone islands or other resorts will not once again become the exclusive privilege of the rich few, as it was decades ago with flying. Amusement parks are turning into ghost towns—perfect, I cannot imagine a more bor- ing and stupid place than Disneyland. Car production is seriously affected—good, this may compel us to think about alternatives to our obsession with individual vehi- cles. The list can go on.
