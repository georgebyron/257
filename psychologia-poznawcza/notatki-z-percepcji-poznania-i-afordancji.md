The way people understand things is through cognition, which is the process by which we acquire knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and our senses.  


When a spider quickly and gracefully traverses the intricacies of a web, or a bird like the green bee-eater on this book’s cover catches an insect in flight, these creatures are relying on their bodies to form a kind of coupling with their environments—a natural, intuitive dance wherein environment and creature work together as a system. These wonderfully evolved, coupled systems result in complex, advanced behavior, yet with no large brains in sight.  


Our most basic actions—the sort we hardly notice we do—work because our bodies are able to perceive and act among the structures of our environment with little or no thought required.

This theory about the body-environment relationship originates in a field called ecological psychology, which posits that creatures directly perceive and act in the world by their bodies’ ability to detect information about the structures in the environment. This information is what I will be calling physical information—a mode of information that is at work when bodies and environments do this coupled, dynamic dance of action and perception.  
  
  


The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception:

Information, as the term is used in this book \(but not in other books\), refers to specification of the observer’s environment, not to specification of the observer’s receptors or sense organs....\[For discussing perception, the term\] information cannot have its familiar dictionary meaning of knowledge communicated to a receiver. This is unfortunate, and I would use another term if I could. The only recourse is to ask the reader to remember that picking up information is not to be thought of as a case of communicating. The world does not speak to the observer. Animals and humans communicate with cries, gestures, speech, pictures, writing and television, but we cannot hope to understand perception in terms of these channels; it is quite the other way around. Words and pictures convey information, carry it, or transmit it, but the information in the sea of energy around each of us, luminous or mechanical or chemical energy, is not conveyed. It is simply there. The assumption that information can be transmitted and the assumption that it can be stored are appropriate for the theory of communication, not for the theory of perception.\[[19](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn02)\]

“To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the environment and of oneself in it.”\[[21](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn04)\] In other words, perception is about the agent, figuring out the elements of its surroundings and understanding how the agent itself is one of those elements. And information is what organisms perceive in the environment that informs the possibilities for action.  


Gibson’s ideas have also found a more recent home as a significant influence in a theoretical perspective called embodied cognition.  


Disembodied cognition:

The process happens through inputs and outputs, with the brain as the “central processing unit”:

1. The brain gathers data about the world through the body’s senses.
2. It then works with abstract representations of what is sensed.
3. The brain processes the representational data by using disembodied rules, models, and logical operations.
4. The brain then takes this disembodied, abstract information and translates it into instructions to the body.

In other words, according to the mainstream view, perception is indirect, and requires representations that are processed the way a computer would process math and logic. The model holds that this is how cognition works for even the most basic bodily action.  


The most common definitions \[of embodied cognition\] involve the straightforward claim that “states of the body modify states of the mind.” However, the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain, body, and the environment, the “states of mind” of disembodied cognitive science won’t exist to be modified. Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory.\[[34](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn17)\]  


The embodied approach insists on understanding perception from the first-person perspective of the perceiving organism, not abstract principles from a third-person observer. A spider doesn’t “know” about webs, or that it’s moving vertically up a surface; it just takes action according to its nature. A bird doesn’t “know” it is flying in air; it just moves its body to get from one place to another through its native medium. For we humans, this can be confusing, because by the time we are just past infancy, we develop a dependence on language and abstraction for talking and thinking about how we perceive the world—a lens that adds a lot of conceptual information to our experience. But the perception and cognition underlying that higher-order comprehension is just about bodies and structures, not concepts. Conscious reflection on our experience happens after the perception, not before.  


In animals with brains, the brain enhances and augments the body. The brain isn’t the center of the behavioral universe; rather, it’s the other way around. It’s this “other way around” perspective that Gibson continually emphasizes in his work.  


This perception-action loop is the dynamo at the center of our cognition. In fact, perception makes up most of what we think of as cognition to begin with. As Louise Barrett puts it in Beyond the Brain: How Body and Environment Shape Animal and Human Minds \(Princeton University Press\), “Once we begin exploring the actual mechanisms that animals use to negotiate their worlds, it becomes hard to decide where ‘perception’ ends and ‘cognition’ starts.”\[[36](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn19)\]Just perceiving the environment’s information already does a lot of the work that we often attribute to brain-based cognition.  


As shown in the perception-action loop of [Figure 4-4](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#model_for_embodied_cognition), we understand our environment by taking action in it.  


Gibson stresses that perception is not a set of discrete inputs and outputs, but happens as a perceptual system that uses all the parts of the system at once, where the distinction between input and output is effaced so that they “are considered together so as to make a continuous loop.”\[[38](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn21)\] The body plays an active part in the dynamical feedback system of perception. Context, then, is also a result of action by a perceiving agent, not a separate set of facts somehow insulated from that active perception. Even when observing faraway stars, astronomers’ actions have effects on how the light that has reached the telescope is interpreted and understood.  


It’s important to stress how deeply physical action and perception are connected, even when we are perceiving “virtual” or screen-based artifacts. In the documentary Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography, legendary cameraman William Fraker tells a story about being the cinematographer on the movie Rosemary’s Baby. At one point, he was filming a scene in which Ruth Gordon’s spry-yet-sinister character, Minnie, is talking on the phone in a bedroom. Fraker explains how director Roman Polanski asked him to move the camera so that Minnie’s face would be mostly hidden by the edge of a doorway, as shown in [Figure 4-7](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#minnieapostrophes_semi-hidden_phone_conv). Fraker was puzzled by the choice, but he went along with it.

Fraker then recounts seeing the movie’s theatrical premiere, during which he noticed the audience actually lean to the right in their seats in an attempt to peek around the bedroom door frame. It turned out that Polanski asked for the odd, occluding angle for a good reason: to engage the audience physically and heighten dramatic tension by obscuring the available visual information.

Gibson uses the phrase perceptual system rather than just “the eye” because we don’t perceive anything with just one isolated sense organ.\[[40](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn23)\] Perception is a function of the whole bodily context. The eye is made of parts, and the eye itself is a part of a larger system of parts, which is itself part of some other larger system. Thus, what we see is influenced by how we move and what we touch, smell, and hear, and vice versa.  


In the specific case of watching a movie, viewers trying to see more of Minnie’s conversation were responding to a virtual experience as if it were a three-dimensional physical environment. They responded this way not because those dimensions were actually there, but because that sort of information was being mimicked on-screen, and taking action—in this case leaning to adjust the angle of viewable surfaces—is what a body does when it wants to detect richer information about the elements in view. As we will see in later chapters, this distinction between directly perceived information and interpreted, simulated-physical information is important to the way we design interfaces between people and digital elements of the environment.  
  


Afordancje  


Affordances are properties of environmental structures that provide opportunities for action to complementary organisms.  


action is required for this information pickup  
  
Also, please remember that affordance is something what is developed through many years  
  
Perception evolved in a natural world full of affordances, but our built environment also has these environmental properties.  
  
Gibson developed it as an answer to Gestalt psychology theories about how we seem to perceive the meaning of something as readily as we perceive its physical properties; rather than splitting these two kinds of meaning apart, he wanted to unify the dualism into one thing: affordance.  
  


#### Affordances exist in the environment whether they are perceived or not

One contemporary theoretical stance argues that we do not perceive real things in the world, but only our brain’s ideas and representations of them. Gibson strongly disagreed, insisting that we couldn’t perceive anything unless there were a real, physical, and measurable relationship between the things in the world and our bodies. He allowed room for a sort of “life of the mind” that might, in a sense, slosh about atop these real foundations, but it exists only because it was able to emerge from physical coupling between creature and world.

Tutaj musisz dobrze to rozegrać, bo nie wierzysz w to, że afordancje istnieją w świecie - one istnieją na przecięciu.  


The properties that give something affordance exist whether they are perceived in the moment or not; they are latent possibilities for action. Affordance is required for perception; but an affordance doesn’t have to be perceived to exist. I might not be able to see the stairs around the corner in a building, but that doesn’t mean the stairs’ ability to support climbing doesn’t exist. This idea complicates the commonly taught concept that a mental model drives behavior. Affordance means the information we need for action does not have to be “mental” and is actually in the structures of the environment. I perceive and use the stairs not because I have a mental model of them; no model is needed because all the information necessary is intrinsic to the shape and substance of the stairs. Prior learned experience might influence my usage in some way, but that’s in addition to perception, not perception itself.  


#### Affordances are there, whether they are perceived accurately or not

A Venus flytrap exists because it can get nutrition. And it gets nutrition because it “tricks” its prey into thinking it is a source of food for the prey, rather than the other way around. For a fly, the affordance of the flytrap is being caught, dissolved, and absorbed by a plant. What the fly perceives, until it is often too late, is “food.” Likewise, we might perceive ground where there is actually quicksand, or a tree branch that is actually a snake. Perception is of the information created by the affordance, not the affordance itself. This is an important distinction that has often been misunderstood in design practice, leading to convoluted discussions of “perceived” versus “actual” affordances. The affordance is a property of the object, not the perception of it.  


The scene from Rosemary’s Baby serves as an apt example of this simulated-object issue. In the scene depicted in [Figure 4-7](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#minnieapostrophes_semi-hidden_phone_conv), moviegoers can’t see Minnie’s mouth moving behind the door frame, even if they shift to the right in their seats, because the information on the screen only simulates what it portrays. There is no real door frame or bedroom that a viewer can perceive more richly via bodily movement. If there were, the door and rooms would have affordances that create directly specifying information for bodies to pick up, informing the body that moving further right will continue revealing more of Minnie’s actions. Of course, some audience members tried this, but calibrated by stopping as soon as their perception picked up that nothing was changing. Then, there were undoubtedly nervous titters in the crowd—how silly that we tried to see more! As we will see later, we tend to begin to interact with information this way, based on what our bodies assume it will give us, even if that information is tricking us or simulating something else, as in digital interfaces.  


In his ecological framework, Gibson refers to any surface on which we show communicative information as a “display.” This includes paintings, sketches, photographs, scrolls, clay tablets, projected images, and even sculptures. To Gibson, a display is “a surface that has been shaped or processed so as to exhibit information for more than just the surface itself.”\[[54](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn37)\] Like a smartphone screen, a surface with writing on it has no intrinsic meaning outside of its surface’s physical information; but we aren’t interested in the surface so much as what we interpret from the writing. Gibson refers to the knowledge one can gain from these information artifacts as mediated or indirect—that is, compared to direct physical information pickup, these provide information via a medium.

Depending on where you read about affordances, you might see [Affordance](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#affordance)used to explain this sort of mediated, indirectly meaningful information. However, for the sake of clarity, I will be specifying [Affordance](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#affordance) as that which creates information about itself, and I will not be using the term for information that is about something beyond the affordance. Images, words, digital interfaces—these things all provide information, but the ultimately relevant meaning we take away from them is not intrinsic. It is interpreted, based on convention or abstraction. 

Our perception is, in a sense, hungry for affordance and tries to find it wherever it can, even from indirectly meaningful information. That is, what matters to the first-person perspective of a user is the blended spectrum of information the user perceives, whether it is direct or indirect. It’s in the teasing apart of these sorts of information where the challenge of context for design truly lies.

### “Satisficing”

Perhaps this loops-of-least-effort idea helps explain a behavior pattern first described by scientist-economist Herbert Simon, who called it satisficing. Satisficing is a concept that explains how we conserve energy by doing whatever is just enough to meet a threshold of acceptability. It’s a portmanteau combining “satisfy” and “suffice.” Its use has been expanded to explain other phenomena, from how people decide what to buy to the way a species changes in response to evolutionary pressures.\[[64](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-context/9781449326531/ch04.html#ftn.ch04fn47)\] Satisficing is a valuable idea for design practice, because it reminds us that users use what we design. They don’t typically ponder it, analyze it, or come to know all its marvelous secrets. They act in the world based on the most obvious information available and with as little concentration as possible. That’s because cognition starts with, and depends upon, continual action and interaction with the environment. Users aren’t motivated by first understanding the environment. They’re too busy just getting things done, and in fact they tend to improvise as they go, often using the environment in different ways than intended by designers  


UMWELT

Umwelt is an idea introduced by biologist Jakob Johann von Uexküll \(1874–1944\), who defined it as the world as perceived and acted upon by a given organism. Uexküll studied the sense organs and behaviors of various creatures such as insects, amoebae, and jellyfish, and developed theories on how these they experience their environments.  


When you’re looking for a parking place at the grocery store, you notice every nuance that might indicate if a space is empty. After you park, you could probably recall how many spaces you thought were empty but turned out to just have small cars or motorcycles parked in them. But, when you’re leaving the store, you’re no longer attending to that task with the same level of explicit concentration; you might notice no empty spaces at all. Instead, you’re trying to locate the lot’s exit, which itself can be an exercise in maddening frustration. The parking lot didn’t change; the physical information is the same. But your perspective shifted enough that other information about different affordances mattered more than it did earlier  
  


Gibson argued that how a person perceives the environment will always lead to some action.  The environment’s affordances act like clues or prompts, indicating or shaping potential pathways for the person’s action.
