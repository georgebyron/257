SPARQL \(pronounced sparkle\) is a query language that enables users to perform information retrieval by querying RDF datasets on the Web of Data. It also enables users to update RDF datasets. During this week, we will see the basic principle of RDF graph pattern matching using SPARQL as well as SPARQL language syntax and statements.
