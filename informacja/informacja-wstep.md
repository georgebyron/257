# Informacja: wstÄ™p

Warren Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of

1\) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory;

2\) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and

3\) what he called \`influential' problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role.
